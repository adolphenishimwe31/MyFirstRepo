Something I’ve learned so far in this course is the importance of corporate governance and its impact on organizational success. I now understand how the board of directors plays a critical role in guiding a company’s strategic direction, ensuring legal compliance, and fostering ethical behavior. This has helped me appreciate the balance between risk management, transparency, and accountability in the decision-making process.
